# Meme-Generator
Built a meme generator in the browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The program consists of a form that accepts a link to an image, text for the top of the meme, and text for the bottom of the meme. When the user submits the form, uses JavaScript to append a div which contains the meme, including the image and its text.
